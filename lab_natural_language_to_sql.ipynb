        "\n",
        "- When tested with slightly ambiguous or unclear questions, the model showed signs of **hallucination**. For example, if the question was vague or had incorrect column names, the generated SQL queries didn’t match the expected output.\n",
        "    \n",

        "\n",
        "- **Non-English Queries**: The model performed excellently with English queries but had trouble generating correct SQL when presented with **Spanish** or other languages. This was mainly due to the model’s limited training on multilingual datasets.\n",

        "\n",
        "### **Strengths of the Model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Efficient and Accurate for Clear Queries:** The model is very effective at generating SQL queries from clear, concise, and well-structured English prompts.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Correct Use of SQL Functions:** It applies SQL functions such as `SUM()`, `JOIN`, `WHERE`, and `JULIANDAY()` correctly in the queries.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Handles Simple Queries Well:** The model is good at generating basic queries that require simple aggregations, filtering, or joining tables.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Weaknesses of the Model:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Language Limitations:** The model struggles with queries in languages other than English. When given a non-English query, such as Spanish, the generated SQL often contains errors.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Typos and Ambiguities:** The model is sensitive to minor errors in the prompt. Typos or ambiguous phrasing can lead to hallucinated or incorrect SQL outputs.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Complex Queries Handling:** The model might fail to generate accurate SQL when faced with more complex queries that require deeper understanding or multiple joins.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "### **What Could Be Improved:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multilingual Capabilities:** The model could be improved by training on a more diverse, multilingual dataset to enhance its ability to handle queries in languages other than English.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Error Tolerance:** The model should be more resilient to minor errors or slight ambiguities in natural language prompts.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Context Understanding:** The model could be improved by better understanding the context of the schema, especially when the prompt doesn’t explicitly define it.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Conclusions and Recommendations:**\n",
        "------------------------------------\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Improvements Needed:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Multilingual Support:** Improve the model's ability to process non-English queries correctly and ensure it handles multiple languages effectively.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Error Handling:** Enhance the model's tolerance to minor typos or ambiguities in the input.\n",
        "    \n",
        "*   **Training on Diverse Datasets:** Training the model on a wider variety of SQL schemas and more complex queries could make it more robust.\n",
        "    \n",
        "\n",
        "### **Practical Use:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The AI model is very effective for generating SQL queries from clear, simple English queries. However, there are limitations when the input language is different or when the instructions are unclear. Enhancing its multilingual capabilities and error resilience would significantly improve its effectiveness.\n"
